# DigitalUniversity1.0

This Project is developed during the HackEd Hackathon,
to help all the students from class 1st to PhD, 
to get audio/video full transcription along with its summary and highlighted key words, 
to grasp everything quickly during examination.
Further, they can get the relevant material/books and timetable to join the online class. 

One of the sub feature used in this project for transcription was taken from ongoing hackathon CB2.0, which started after HackEd and ended before HackEd Hackathon.
